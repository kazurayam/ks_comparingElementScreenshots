# Why Katalon Studio's WebUI.verifyImagePresent keyword doesn't work for me?

- [page1](http://kazurayam.github.io/ks_verifyImagePresent/page1.html) passes because the image is displayed in the viewport with original width
- [page2](http://kazurayam.github.io/ks_verifyImagePresent/page2.html) fails because the image is resized
- [page3](http://kazurayam.github.io/ks_verifyImagePresent/page3.html) fails because the image is out of viewport
